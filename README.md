# 3DRenderer - Ray Tracer Project

This is a basic 3D renderer and ray tracer built. 
It generates 3D images in the PPM format, following concepts from Peter Shirley's "Ray Tracing in One Weekend." 
The goal is to expand this project into a full-featured game engine.

## Features

### Completed
- Ray tracing fundamentals
  - Rays, spheres, and camera setup
- Image generation in PPM format
- Support for CMake build system

### Planned
- Lambertian (diffuse), metal, and dielectric (glass) materials
- Acceleration structures (BVH)
- Real-time ray tracing (GPU support)
- Scene description and import/export (e.g., OBJ or GLTF)
- Game engine functionality (input handling, physics, etc.)
- Multithreaded rendering
